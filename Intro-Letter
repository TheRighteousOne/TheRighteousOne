- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheRighteousOne
- 👀 I’m interested in using code to serve humanity in the highest sense. 
     I want us to know exactly why we use the technology we use and thus when we should opt to leave it aside.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamental languages (JS, React, C, Python etc.).
     I'm hoping to branch into Web3 where I can help use algorithms for the good of humanity, not to spy and manipulate. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone with knowledge on how to accelerate personal improvement and skill advancement within this space.
- 📫 How to reach me: Reach out via email for my Discord name.
